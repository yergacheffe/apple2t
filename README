Issues / Todo

1. Biggest current issue is that the .Net code as it stands today
   doesn't work with Twitter. This is because Twitter no longer
   supports basic-auth and requires OAuth. The code in WallItem.cs
   will need to be changed. I have updated the version of the
   TweetSharp Twitter API wrapper, which supports OAuth. So this
   shouldn't be a lot of work.

2. Finish documentation on how to get the initial code to the Apple II
