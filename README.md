# Apple IIt

Documentation is getting fleshed out. For the ambitious among you, take a look at 
Documentation.pdf which explains what you'll need to purchase to construct the 
PC->Apple II communication cable.

At this point there should be enough info and working code for a motivated individual
to get their own Apple II Twitter Display up and running. It's mostly cleanup and 
better documentation that's lacking now.
